# ESP32 Automated Watering System Strawberry Tower WIP 

This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller to read the value of the soil moisture sensor and, after a certain threshold, drives a relay that controls the irrigation pump connected to a soaker hose in the middle of the strawberry tower.

## To-Do list:
-Add ntp server for real time clock (get bigger display)
-Redesign display interface for better visibility(scrolling pages?)
-Maybe add ability for OTA update
-Start desgining 3D printed Waterproof enclosure with solar panel on top for charging 18650 battery
-Add schematics and photos
